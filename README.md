# 🔐 Cybersecurity Lab Environment Setup

**Building an isolated virtual lab for penetration testing and ethical hacking practice**


## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on setting up a **virtual cybersecurity and penetration-testing laboratory** using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.

The purpose of the lab is to create a controlled environment where cybersecurity tools, network scanning, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and other security-testing activities can be performed safely and repeatedly.

The lab is configured on a private virtual network so that additional machines can be added later and used as targets for authorized security testing.

---


## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Install and configure VirtualBox.
- Install/import Kali Linux as a virtual machine.
- Create a private **NAT Network** for the cybersecurity lab.
- Configure network connectivity for Kali Linux.
- Assign a consistent IP address to the Kali VM.
- Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution.


## 🛡️ Purpose of the Lab

The lab provides an isolated and controlled environment for cybersecurity learning and authorized security testing.

It can be used for activities such as:

- Network reconnaissance
- Port scanning
- Vulnerability assessment
- Packet analysis





## ⚙️ Lab Configuration

| 🧩 Component       | ⚙️ Configuration   |
| ------------------ | ------------------  |
| 🖥️ Host OS         | Kali Linux       |
| 🧠 Host RAM        | 8 GB               |
| ⚡ Processor       | Intel Core i7      |

# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure

## Step 1. Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.

**Tool:** 7-Zip

---

## Step 2. Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox was installed as the hypervisor.

---

## Step 3. Create the NAT Network

A dedicated NAT Network was created in VirtualBox.

Configuration:
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled



A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.


## Step 4. Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
```

The VM was allocated:

```text
RAM: 2048 MB
```

A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.



---

## Step 5. Configure the Kali Linux Network

The Kali Linux network configuration was checked and configured with a consistent IPv4 address.

Example configuration:

```text
IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
```

| 🧰 Verify Nmap                | `nmap --version`                | Nmap version displayed          |
| 🔄 Verify snapshot            | Restore snapshot and run `ip a` | Baseline configuration restored |

# 🐞 Problems Encountered & Solutions

Documenting problems is an important part of the project.

## Problem 1. Internet Connectivity After Static IP Configuration

After manually configuring the IPv4 settings, Internet connectivity may fail depending on the Kali/NetworkManager configuration.

One workaround used during this lab was:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dad-timeout 0
```

The network connection was then restarted/rebooted and connectivity was tested again.

> **Important:** Network interface and connection names may differ between systems. Students should first identify their actual connection name before running an `nmcli` command.

# 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to create and configure a virtual environment for cybersecurity practice.

The most important concepts I learned include:

### 1. NAT vs NAT Network

A standard NAT configuration and a NAT Network serve different purposes.

A NAT Network allows multiple VMs connected to the same virtual network to communicate with one another while providing network address translation for external connectivity.

This makes it useful for building a multi-machine cybersecurity laboratory.

### 2. Virtual Machine Networking

I learned how VirtualBox virtual network adapters connect virtual machines to different types of networks and how network configuration affects communication between machines.

### 3. Static IP Configuration

I learned how to configure and verify IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS settings in Kali Linux.


### 5. Documentation

I learned that documenting commands, configuration, screenshots, problems, and solutions is an important part of a professional cybersecurity project.
